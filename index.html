  <p><strong>This individual, Adarsh Prashant Mhatre, is a notorious scammer who has deceived numerous women under various aliases, including Jayesh Patil, Tanmay Mhatre, Aditya Mhatre, and Navhoosh Mhatre.</strong></p>
  <p>Adarsh Mhatre is originally from <strong>Kegaon, Uran, District Raigad</strong>, and has lived in <strong>Hashiware, Alibaug (his maternal home)</strong>, and <strong>Bhopal</strong>. Currently, he resides in <strong>Pune</strong> but frequently visits his family and relatives in <strong>Turade, Rasayani, and the Panvel area</strong>. To evade authorities, he constantly changes his location and identity.</p>
  <p>Adarsh Mhatre is a married man with a wife and son who live in <strong>Bhopal</strong>. He has been carrying out these fraudulent activities since <strong>2019</strong> and continues to do so despite being arrested multiple times. This highlights a significant failure of the <strong>police and judiciary</strong>, as he remains free to exploit more victims.</p>
  <p>Adarsh Mhatre is known to flaunt his ill-gotten wealth on <strong>social media</strong>, showcasing <strong>luxury cars</strong> and a lavish lifestyle. He often arrives to meet his victims with a <strong>chauffeur-driven car</strong>, further enhancing his false image of success. Reports also indicate that he spends large sums of money on <strong>gambling</strong> and stays at <strong>luxury hotels in Goa</strong>.</p>

  <p>Adarsh Mhatre impersonates high-ranking professionals such as an <strong>ISRO scientist, IAS officer, or IPS officer</strong>, using fake ID cards and fabricated documents to gain the trust of his victims. He often claims to be seeking a bride and lures women, particularly working professionals in <strong>Pune, Mumbai, and Thane</strong>, into his trap. Once he gains their trust, he manipulates them emotionally and financially, defrauding them of significant amounts of money.He even persuades women to take instant loans, claiming he is in urgent need of money and promising to repay them within a few days, which he never does.</p>
  <p><strong>Reports indicate that he has duped over 50 women</strong>, extracting amounts ranging from <strong>₹5 lakh to ₹35 lakh</strong> from individual victims. He has <strong>multiple legal cases</strong> registered against him for cheating and fraud. Despite his arrests, he continues to exploit unsuspecting individuals by adopting new aliases and strategies.</p>
